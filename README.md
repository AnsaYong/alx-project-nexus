# ProDev Backend Engineering Program
Welcome to the ProDev Backend Engineering program! This repository is designed as a guide through essential backend
engineering concepts, real-world challenges, and solutions. The ProDev program emphasizes practical, hands-on learning,
ensuring ProDevs can apply what they've learned to real projects. Below, is comprehensive documentation, lessons,
and challenges based on industry best practices.

## Key Features
### 1. Comprehensive Documentation
The program covers crucial backend engineering tools and practices, each of which is explored in detail in the lessons below.

**Lesson 1: Introduction to Django and Django REST Framework**
- **RESTful APIs:** Learn to design and implement RESTful APIs using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). You'll understand how to handle HTTP requests, manage resources, and build endpoint structures that communicate effectively between frontend and backend systems.
- **GraphQL APIs:** In this section, you'll also learn how to extend your backend to support GraphQL, providing more flexible data querying and reducing over-fetching of data.

**Lesson 2: Advanced Django Features: Middleware, Signals, and ORM**
- **Django Middleware:** Explore how to use middleware to process requests globally, handle sessions, and manage user authentication. You'll understand how to customize middleware to fit project needs.
- **Signals:** Learn how to handle events across your Django application using signals for actions like sending notifications after saving models or triggering background jobs.
- **Advanced ORM Techniques:** Dive deeper into Django’s ORM, covering complex queries, efficient use of joins, and optimizing database interactions.

**Lesson 3: Advanced Git Techniques and Workflows**
- **Version Control:** Master advanced Git techniques such as branching strategies (GitFlow, feature branching, and forking workflows) and best practices for collaborating on large teams. You’ll also learn how to manage merging and rebasing to maintain clean code history.
- **Rebasing and Merging:** Understand when to use merging versus rebasing to integrate changes, how to avoid common pitfalls, and resolve conflicts.
- **Stashing and Cherry-Picking:** Learn how to handle uncommitted changes with stashing and selectively apply commits using cherry-picking.
- **Collaborative Workflows:** You’ll learn how to manage team collaboration using pull requests, code reviews, and resolving merge conflicts efficiently.

**Lesson 4: Containerization with Docker & Kubernetes**
- **Docker:** Learn the fundamentals of containerization with Docker, including creating Docker images for your backend services. This lesson helps you deploy your backend systems in isolated containers, improving consistency across environments.
- **Kubernetes:** Understand how Kubernetes orchestrates Docker containers, allowing you to scale, manage, and monitor backend services across multiple instances.

**Lesson 5: CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment:** This lesson teaches you how to set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions. Learn how to automate code testing, building, and deployment, ensuring that code is automatically pushed to production when changes are made.
- **Automated Testing:** You’ll configure tests in your CI pipeline, ensuring your backend code is always tested before deployment.

**Lesson 6: Payment Integration with Chapa API**
- **Integrating Payment Systems:** In this lesson, you’ll learn how to integrate payment gateways, specifically the Chapa API, to handle online transactions. You’ll implement payment processing in your backend, securely managing payment data and ensuring smooth integration into your APIs.

**Lesson 7: Setting Up Background Jobs for Email Notifications**
- **Celery & RabbitMQ:** Learn how to manage background tasks using Celery and RabbitMQ. You'll set up asynchronous email notifications to improve system performance and user experience by offloading time-consuming tasks to background workers.

**Lesson 8: System Design for Scalable Backend Architectures**
-**System Design:** Gain an understanding of designing scalable, high-performance backend systems. Explore architecture patterns, microservices, database scaling, and load balancing to handle increasing traffic and maintain high availability.

### 2. Challenges & Solutions
In the program, real-world backend development challenges are presented alongside the implemented solutions:

- **Scaling APIs:** Learn how to design APIs that can handle millions of requests per day, using tools like caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling.
- **Handling Data Consistency:** Understand strategies like eventual consistency and transactional integrity when working with distributed databases.
- **Optimizing CI/CD Pipelines:** Tackle the challenge of optimizing your CI/CD pipeline to ensure rapid deployments without sacrificing reliability.
- **Background Job Management:** Implement solutions to offload time-consuming tasks using Celery and RabbitMQ, ensuring your backend can handle high-load operations.

### 3. Best Practices & Takeaways
This program highlights industry best practices to ensure the systems you develop are efficient, secure, and maintainable:

- **API Design:** Learn to follow RESTful principles and GraphQL practices, ensuring your APIs are intuitive and easy to consume by frontend developers.
- **Version Control:** Advanced Git practices, including proper branching strategies, code reviews, and conflict resolution, ensure collaboration runs smoothly.
- **Performance Optimization:** Best practices for optimizing code, databases, and infrastructure, including indexing strategies, query optimization, and load testing.
- **Security:** Understand how to secure your backend systems through authentication mechanisms, role-based access control (RBAC), and encryption techniques.
- **Testing:** Automate unit and integration tests as part of your CI pipeline, ensuring that your backend code is always reliable and bug-free.

### 4. Collaboration Hub
The program encourages collaboration between frontend and backend learners:

- **API-first Development:** The backend APIs are designed to work seamlessly with the frontend, whether it's a web, mobile, or desktop application. You'll learn how to structure APIs to ensure smooth communication between both ends.

- **Project Integration:** Collaborate with frontend developers to integrate backend services, ensuring the system is cohesive and user-friendly. Real-time feedback loops and collaboration ensure that each aspect of the system is aligned.
